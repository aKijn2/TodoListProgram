# TaskFlow

A minimalist, high-performance task management application built with **.NET MAUI 9.0** for Windows. Designed with a strict monochrome aesthetic for distraction-free productivity.

## Features

### Minimalist Design
- **Monochrome Theme**: Black & white interface with glassmorphism elements.
- **Distraction-Free**: Clean typography and layouts focused on content.
- **Micro-interactions**: Subtle hover effects and responsive UI elements.

### Core Functionality
- **Search & Filter**: Instantly search tasks by title/description with a sleek search bar.
- **Task Management**: Create, edit, and delete tasks with ease.
- **Subtasks**: Break complex tasks into manageable sub-steps.
- **Smart Filtering**: "To Do", "Active", and "Done" tabs for quick navigation.
- **Due Dates**: Set deadlines and track overdue items.

### Technical Highlights
- **Local Storage**: Secure, offline-first SQLite database (`Documents/Todo_asa` storage), feel free to change the path and name in the `DatabaseService.cs` file.
- **AOT Compatible**: Fully optimized ViewModels avoiding reflection-heavy MVVM features.
- **Performance**: Instant load times and smooth transitions.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: .NET MAUI 9.0
- **Database**: SQLite (sqlite-net-pcl)
